# Nairobi Healthcare Investment Strategy – 2025

This project explores healthcare accessibility gaps in **Nairobi County** and proposes an investment strategy to strengthen healthcare delivery by 2025.

## Project Overview

The project investigates the mismatch between population needs and available healthcare services, highlighting under-served districts and critical service gaps. It combines data-driven analysis with strategic recommendations for facility expansion, service upgrades, and workforce training.

## The Problem

Millions of households in Nairobi lack access to essential healthcare. Key findings include:

* Child Health Services: Only 7.6% coverage.
* HIV & Infectious Disease Treatment: Only 11.6% coverage.
* Maternal & Reproductive Health: 29.7% coverage.
* Emergency & Specialized Care: 31.5% coverage.

No healthcare category currently meets minimum service standards, largely due to a shortage of facilities, equipment, and trained staff.
